## arkit-vehicle-movement

This is a basic project that shows how we can use RealityKit, specifically RealityKit Composer, to make custom actions for AR objects.

## Object Functionality 

- Choose and select custom behavior for your object in Reality Composer.
- In the trigger section, opt for using Notification as we intend to activate this behavior through code.
- In the action section, you can define various functionalities such as spinning, movement, hiding, showing, and more.
